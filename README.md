# CryptoNotes
Phone Application providing end-to-end encryption using PGP

The app functionality is:

- View a list of generated PGP keys.
- Create a new PGP key set.
- Save public keys.
- Send public keys through the share panel.
- Send an encrypted message through the share panel.
- Decrypt a PGP message.

In all cases the keys are stored in a local SQLite database.

It currently uses PGPCore for PGP functionality.

Future features:
* Self destruct and delete all keys
* Button animations
* Needs more design
